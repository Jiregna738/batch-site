        <p class="card-text"> This is where Ellie puts all the stuff she wants us to know about her. Some basics: she's Taiwanese-American, but has been living in Berlin for nearly 7 years. Unfortunately, her German is not quite up-to-speed... yet. still. But soon! And until then, she speaks just English, Spanish and Mandarin, can understand a bit of Catalan and Taiwanese. <br> Other fun facts about Ellie: She loves to play beach-volley, spin, dance and do yoga when she has time. She also really loves music, so she's almost always got her headphones on. She listens to anything from jazz, to hip-hop, R&B on chill days, but also loves all kinds of house music to get things moving. Her favorite color is between Teal and Turquoise. Her favorite snacks are dried mangos, nuts and an occasional piece of milk chocolate (or five). Her favorite cuisines are usually under the umbrella of Asian food, be it Indonesian, Taiwanese, Japanese, Korean or Thai... guess it makes sense that her favorite condiments are sichuan pepper flakes and sriracha sauce. Now that's enough about Ellie, right?</p>
